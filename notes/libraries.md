## terminology

### tree shaking

tree shaking enables us to declare, for each module

- imports
- exports

the bundler (Webpack, Rollup, etc) analyses the dependency tree

all unused code is dropped from the final bundle in the same way a person can shake a tree and what is not vitally attached will fall out of the tree
